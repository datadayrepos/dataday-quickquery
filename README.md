## Download

Download the latest version from the [releases page](https://github.com/mmghv/QuickQuery/releases), it's a standalone executable that doesn't need installation.

Currently only built for `Windows`, if there's a request for `Linux` or `MacOS` I may setup a workflow to build for it. Alternatively, you can use the instructions provided in the following section to build it yourself from the source code on your system.
